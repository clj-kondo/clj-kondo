## Rationale

Clj-kondo performs static analysis on Clojure, ClojureScript and EDN, without the need of a running REPL. It informs you about potential errors while you are typing.

## Features

Clj-kondo detects:

* inline `def` expressions
* redundant `do` and `let` wrappings
* arity errors:
  - within the same namespace and across namespaces
  - of static Java method calls
  - of local `let` and `letfn` binding calls
  - of recursive calls (including `recur`)
  - conflicting arities in overloaded functions
* unused private vars
* private and deprecated var usage
* required but unused namespaces
* unsorted required namespaces
* referred but unused vars
* duplicate requires
* unused function arguments and let bindings
* marked as unused, but used arguments and let bindings (optional)
* unused imports
* redefined vars
* unresolved symbols, vars and namespaces
* misplaced docstrings
* duplicate map keys and set elements
* duplicates and quoting in case test constants
* missing map keys
* invalid number of forms in binding vectors
* missing assertions in `clojure.test/deftest`
* alias consistency
* [type checking](doc/types.md)
* Datalog syntax checking
* format string argument mismatches
* shadowed vars
* 2 argument usage of reduce (optional)

before your form hits the REPL.

It suggests several style guide recommendations, such as:

* rules from Stuart Sierra's [how to ns](https://stuartsierra.com/2016/clojure-how-to-ns.html)
* use `:else` as the catch-all test expression in `cond` (see [Clojure style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide#else-keyword-in-cond))
* use `seq` instead of `(not (empty? ,,,))` (see [Clojure style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide#nil-punning))
* don't make your lines too long (see [Clojure style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide#80-character-limits))

<img src="screenshots/wrong-arity.png" width="50%" align="right">

It has support for syntax of commonly used macros like
`clojure.core.async/alt!!`, `schema.core/defn` and `potemkin/import-vars`.

It detects common errors in `deps.edn` and `bb.edn`

It provides [analysis data](analysis) so you build your own custom linters.

View all available linters [here](doc/linters.md).

This linter is:

* compatible with `.clj`, `.cljs`, `.cljc` and `.edn` files
* build tool and editor agnostic
* a static code analyzer
* compiled to native code using GraalVM

## Usage

### Command line

Lint from stdin:

``` shellsession
$ echo '(def x (def x 1))' | clj-kondo --lint -
<stdin>:1:8: warning: inline def
```

Lint a file:

``` shellsession
$ echo '(def x (def x 1))' > /tmp/foo.clj
$ clj-kondo --lint /tmp/foo.clj
/tmp/foo.clj:1:8: warning: inline def
```

Lint a directory:

``` shellsession
$ clj-kondo --lint src
src/clj_kondo/test.cljs:7:1: warning: redundant do
src/clj_kondo/calls.clj:291:3: error: Wrong number of args (1) passed to clj-kondo.calls/analyze-calls
```

Lint a project classpath:

``` shellsession
$ clj-kondo --lint "$(lein classpath)"
```

## Project setup

To detect lint errors across namespaces in your project, a cache is needed. To
let clj-kondo know where to create one, make a `.clj-kondo` directory in the
root of your project, meaning on the same level as your `project.clj`,
`deps.edn` or `build.boot`:

``` clojure
$ mkdir -p .clj-kondo
```

A cache will be created inside of it when you run `clj-kondo`. Before linting
inside your editor, it is recommended to lint the entire classpath to teach
`clj-kondo` about all the libraries you are using, including Clojure and/or
ClojureScript itself. Some libraries come with configurations. To import them, first run:

``` shellsession
$ clj-kondo --lint "<classpath>" --dependencies --copy-configs --skip-lint
```

The `--copy-configs` flag will search and copy configurations from dependencies into the
`.clj-kondo` directory, while linting (see
[config.md](doc/config.md#exporting-and-importing-configuration)).

With the configurations in place, now we can analyze the dependencies properly:

``` shellsession
$ clj-kondo --lint "<classpath>" --dependencies --parallel
```

The `--dependencies` flag indicates that clj-kondo is used to analyze sources to
populate the cache. When enabled, clj-kondo will suppress warnings and skips over
already linted `.jar` files for performance.

The `--parallel` option will use multiple threads to lint your sources, going through them faster.

NOTE: in the version after `2024.05.24` copying configs and linting dependencies can be done in one go using:

``` shellsession
$ clj-kondo --lint "<classpath>" --dependencies --parallel --copy-configs
```

Build tool specific ways to get a classpath:
- `lein classpath`
- `boot with-cp -w -f -`
- `clojure -Spath`
- `npx shadow-cljs classpath`

So for `lein` the entire command would be:

    $ clj-kondo --lint "$(lein classpath)" --dependencies --parallel --copy-configs

Now you are ready to lint single files using [editor
integration](doc/editor-integration.md). A simulation of what happens when you
edit a file in your editor:

``` shellsession
$ echo '(select-keys)' | clj-kondo --lang cljs --lint -
<stdin>:1:1: error: Wrong number of args (0) passed to cljs.core/select-keys
```

Since clj-kondo now knows about your version of ClojureScript via the cache,
it detects that the number of arguments you passed to `select-keys` is
invalid. Each time you edit a file, the cache is incrementally updated, so
clj-kondo is informed about new functions you just wrote.

If you want to use a different directory to read and write the cache, use the
`--cache-dir` option. To disable the cache even if you have a `.clj-kondo`
directory, use `--cache false`.

## [Configuration](doc/config.md)

## [Editor integration](doc/editor-integration.md)

## Exit codes

Exit codes can be controlled by the `--fail-level <level>` option. The
default fail level is `warning` which returns exit codes as follows:

- `0`: no errors or warnings were found
- `2`: one or more warnings were found
- `3`: one or more errors were found

If `--fail-level error` is supplied, warnings do not lead to a non-zero exit code:

- `0`: no errors were found
- `0`: one or more warnings were found
- `3`: one or more errors were found

All exit codes other than `0`, `2` and `3` indicate an error because of a bug in
clj-kondo or some other unexpected error beyond the control of clj-kondo.

## Macros

As clj-kondo is a static analyzer is does not need a runtime (JVM, browser,
Node.js, etc.). It doesn't execute your code. As such it can be a faster
alternative to linters that do use a runtime, like
[eastwood](https://github.com/jonase/eastwood). This approach comes with the
limitation that clj-kondo cannot execute your macros as macros can use arbitrary
features from a runtime. Clj-kondo has support for clojure core macros and some
popular libraries from the community. Macros that are not supported out of the
box can be supported using
[configuration](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/config.md#unrecognized-macros). One
of the ways to configure macros is to write
[hooks](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/hooks.md) for
them (also see this
[blogpost](https://blog.michielborkent.nl/clj-kondo-hooks.html)).
For many libraries there is already a configuration available that you can
[import](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/config.md#importing). Also
check out clj-kondo [configs](https://github.com/clj-kondo/configs) which
contains configurations for third party libraries.

## Babashka pod

Clj-kondo can be invoked as a [babashka
pod](https://github.com/babashka/babashka.pods).

``` clojure
#!/usr/bin/env bb
(ns script
  (:require [babashka.pods :as pods]))

(pods/load-pod "clj-kondo")
(require '[pod.borkdude.clj-kondo :as clj-kondo])

(clj-kondo/merge-configs
 '{:linters {:unresolved-symbol {:exclude [(foo1.bar)]}}}
 '{:linters {:unresolved-symbol {:exclude [(foo2.bar)]}}})
;;=> {:linters {:unresolved-symbol {:exclude [(foo1.bar) (foo2.bar)]}}}

(-> (clj-kondo/run! {:lint ["src"]})
    :summary)
;;=> {:error 0, :warning 0, :info 0, :type :summary, :duration 779}
```
